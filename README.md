#### Install ERPNext

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Websoft9/docker-erpnext
cd docker-erpnext
public_ip=`wget -O - https://download.websoft9.com/ansible/get_ip.sh | bash`  
sudo sed -i s/erpnext.example.com/$public_ip/g ./.env
docker network create -d bridge websoft9
docker-compose  up -d
```

### FAQ

#### Do I need to change the password before docker-compose up?
Yes, you should modify all database password and application password at docker-compose file for production

#### Docker runing failed for the reason that port conflict?
You should modify ports at [docker-compose file](docker-compose-production.yml) and docker-compose again

#### Why does the erptext port use 8000, which violates the encoding specification of the compose file?  
The use of 9001 or other ports will lead to errors in some containers and make the application unable to access normally  
#### The default startup is erpnext12, What should I do if I want to run another version?  
 If you want to run erpnext13, you only need to change ERPNEXT_VERSION/FRAPPE_VERSIO to V13;Please delete volumes before edit configure
